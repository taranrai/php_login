# PHP Autos Website
Combining a login page, a homepage and an autos page where you populate a MySQL database. 
In this example site, we use PHP Data Objects (PDO) as a database access layer which provides a uniform method of access to multiple databases. It doesn't rewrite SQL or emulate missing features; instead, it allows a developer to use the native features of the database for best performance.
